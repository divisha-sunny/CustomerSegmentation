This project aims to analyze credit card customer behavior using machine learning techniques. Initially, K-means clustering is used to segment customers into groups based on their characteristics. Then, various classification algorithms are tested to predict customer behavior, with Gradient Boosting identified as the most accurate model. A user-friendly Streamlit app is developed for users to input their information and receive predictions about their cluster.
